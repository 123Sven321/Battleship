Just a little Battleship game (aka. 'Schiffe versenken' in Germany) played in your terminal.


How to play:

1. You have to first compile the c-type file.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the instructions in your terminal.
   
Basically both players enter their ships in a 10x10 matrix.
Afterwards you take turns on trying to hit the enemy ships until all ships of one player are destroyed.



The game can be run on Windows and Linux.

Have Fun!


DISCLAIMER:
I have to admit I am not an c expert. It is possible that there are some Bugs I am not aware of.
This is a project made to better understand c coding and as a code sample for Applications.
